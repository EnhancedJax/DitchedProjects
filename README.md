Past rainmeter projects which were never finished. All the projects here are made by me and aims to replace the start menu, but failed due to number of reasons.
Please also note that they are not meant to be stable or user friendly, as they are never near completed.

### Warning: Some skins would turn your taskbar off directly. You can restore it by [restarting explorer.exe](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-restart-windows-explorer)


# List of skins
### RainCenter
![](https://github.com/EnhancedJax/DitchedProjects/blob/master/RainCenter/%40Resources/Graphics/GUIs/Logo.png)

RainCenter allows you to replace the start menu with whatever you want. You can customize the behavior and add presets to it. The project was ditched due to lack of interest and motivation. This is the most functional one in the list.

My first project, which aims to create a sci-fi fancy menu. The module contains 4 pages for Apps, Games, Websites and Control. Some of the images reference in the skin are broken. I will fix those in the upcoming v1 release if I decided to patch all the projects.
